* tab-bar-echo-area.el

Provides a global minor mode to temporarily display a list of available
tab names (with the current tab's name highlighted) in the echo area
after tab-related commands.

The list of tab names shows after creating, closing, switching to, and
renaming a tab, and remains visible until the next command is issued.

This is intended to be used as an unobtrusive replacement for the Emacs
built-in display of the tab-bar (that is, when you have =tab-bar-show=
set to =nil=).

The idea is to provide but a quick visual orientation aid to the user
after tab-related commands, and then get out of the way again.

I recommend using this in combination with the [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-lost-commands][tab-bar-lost-commands]]
package, which provides simple and convenient commands that help with
common tab bar use-cases regarding the creation, selection and movement
of tabs.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =tab-bar-echo-area.el=, put
it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(tab-bar-echo-area-mode 1)= or =M-x tab-bar-echo-area-mode= to turn on
the provided minor mode.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-echo-area
  :ensure t
  :config
  (tab-bar-echo-area-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Screenshots

Showing 3 tab names =foobar=, =barbaz=, =bazqux=, with =bazqux= being
highlighted as the current tab.

* Commands

Table of available commands and their description.

| Command                             | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =tab-bar-echo-area-print-tab-name=  | Print the current tab's name to the echo area                       |
| =tab-bar-echo-area-print-tab-names= | Print all tab names to the echo area (highlight current tab's name) |

* Recommended Keybindings

Note that this package doesn't bind any keys by itself.

In my local configuration, I added bindings for the above commands to
the pre-existing keymap for tab-related commands (=C-x t=):
 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-echo-area
  :ensure t
  :demand t
  :config
  (tab-bar-echo-area-mode 1)
  :bind (:map tab-prefix-map
              ("c" . tab-bar-echo-area-print-tab-name)
              ("p" . tab-bar-echo-area-print-tab-names)))
#+end_src
