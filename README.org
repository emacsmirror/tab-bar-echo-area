* tab-bar-echo-area.el

Provides a global minor mode to temporarily display a list of
available tabs and tab groups (with the current tab and group
highlighted) in the echo area after tab-related commands.

This is intended to be used as an unobtrusive replacement for the
Emacs built-in display of the tab-bar (that is, when you have
=tab-bar-show= set to =nil=).

The idea is to provide but a quick visual orientation aid to the user
after tab-related commands, and then get out of the way again.

I recommend using this together with the [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-lost-commands][tab-bar-lost-commands]] package,
which provides simple and convenient commands that help with common tab
bar use-cases regarding the creation, selection and movement of tabs.
You might also want to check out the [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-groups][tab-bar-groups]] package, which
backports a simplified version of Emacs 28 tab groups to Emacs 27 and
provides an integration with this package.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =tab-bar-echo-area.el=, put
it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(tab-bar-echo-area-mode 1)= or =M-x tab-bar-echo-area-mode= to turn on
the provided minor mode.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-echo-area
  :ensure
  :config
  (tab-bar-echo-area-mode))
#+end_src

* Screenshots

Showing 3 tab names =foobar=, =barbaz=, =bazqux=, with =bazqux= being
highlighted as the current tab.

Showing a closed tab group =foo=, the current tab group =bar= with tabs
=barbaz= and =barbam=, and an ungrouped tab =bazqux=, with =barbam=
being highlighted as the current tab (requires Emacs 28 or the
[[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-groups][tab-bar-groups]] package for tab groups).

The faces applied to the current/other tabs and groups are fully
customizable.

* Commands

Table of available commands and their description.

| Command                               | Description                                                           |
|---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =tab-bar-echo-area-display-tab-name=  | Display the current tab's name in the echo area                       |
| =tab-bar-echo-area-display-tab-names= | Display all tab names in the echo area (highlight current tab's name) |

* Recommended Keybindings

Note that this package doesn't bind any keys by itself.

In my local configuration, I added bindings for the above commands to
the pre-existing keymap for tab-related commands (=C-x t=):
 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package tab-bar-echo-area
  :ensure
  :demand
  :config
  (tab-bar-echo-area-mode)
  :bind (:map tab-prefix-map
              ("c" . tab-bar-echo-area-display-tab-name)
              ("P" . tab-bar-echo-area-display-tab-names)))
#+end_src
